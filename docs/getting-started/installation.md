# Installation

## Prerequisites

- Python >= 3.8

## Install with pip

```sh
pip install agora-agents
```

## Install with Poetry

```sh
poetry add agora-agents
```

## Imports

```python
from agora_agent import Agent, Agora, Area, DeepgramSTT, OpenAI
```

The package installs as `agora-agents` and imports as `agora_agent`.

Every `Agent` builder must receive a bound client:

```python
from agora_agent import Agent, Agora, Area

client = Agora(area=Area.US, app_id="your-app-id", app_certificate="your-app-certificate")
agent = Agent(client=client)
```

## Sync vs. Async

The SDK supports both synchronous and asynchronous usage:

- **Synchronous** — import `Agora` from `agora_agent` and use blocking method calls
- **Asynchronous** — import `AsyncAgora` and `AsyncAgentSession` from `agora_agent` and use `await` with all API calls

```python
# Sync
from agora_agent import Agora, Area

# Async
from agora_agent import AsyncAgora, AsyncAgentSession, Area
```

- [Quick Start](./quick-start.md) — build your first conversational agent

## Migrating from a previous package name

The PyPI distribution was renamed from `agora-agent-server-sdk` to `agora-agents` in v2.0.0. Install `agora-agents`; the import path remains `agora_agent`.

The legacy PyPI name remains available as a compatibility shim that re-exports `agora-agents`. See [compat/agora-agent-server-sdk](../../compat/agora-agent-server-sdk/README.md).

For release and version details, see [changelog — Migration notes](../../changelog.md#migration-notes).
